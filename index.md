# Donald Trump should be impeached.

It's not just **bad policy** or **rash decision making**. In a few short months in power, Donald Trump and his administration have severely eroded the foundations of liberty in America in unconstitutional ways.

The President has committed too many impeachable offenses already in this 2nd term; **he must be impeached**.

At the very least, Congress must express *some* limitations on the extent of egregious, illegal conduct that they will tolerate from the President and the executive branch.

There have been too many impeachable acts to remember them all without writing them down, so here is a list of as many of them as I can remember. This list will be updated as he commits new ones, which seems to happen just about every day.

# 1. High Crimes and Misdemeanors

1. [The deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia](details/kilmar-abrego-garcia.md)
    > ICE detained him and subsequently violated a court order that forbade him from being deported to El Salvador, and sent him directly to CECOT without ever convicting him of a crime.
2. [The deportation of Andry Hernandez](details/andry-hernandez.md)
    > Andry Hernandez was an asylum seeker who came to the US in August of 2024. There has been no evidence presented that Andry Hernandez was guilty of any crimes or a member of a gang. He has been imprisoned in CECOT since mid-March 2025.
3. [The deportation of 238 Venezuelan Men](details/alien-enemies-act.md)
    > 238 men were deported under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) based on allegations that they were members of Tren de Aragua. Reviews of the 238 men deported found that only 50 of them had a criminal record.

# 2. Despicable Conduct

# 3. Everyday Indiscretions
